<h1 style="text-align: center;"> < PORTFOLIO /> </h1>
<hr style="margin-top: -10px;">

Better known as < AYPM />, my portfolio is a web page created to represent me as a developer and my abilities as a programmer. Right now in development, this is a page where I can practice some CSS and HTML and make cool things!

Builded with [`Svelte`](https://svelte.dev/), and [`TailwindCSS`](https://tailwindui.com/). I think is a great way to show others with I've been up to and how I represent myself in the websites.

<div style="margin-top: 40px; display: flex; padding-right: 20px; padding-left: 20px; gap: 20px">

<span style="width: 50%; text-align: center">
    <h2 style="text-align: center;"> Promise </h2>

    I wanted to make an awesome website
    as my portfolio to challenge myself
    to be creative and have the ability
    to impress everyone that sees it.

    Obviously, this is not a website like
    those in the top 10 best portfolios
    for front-end developers ðŸ¤ªðŸ˜®. But
    newer versions of the portfolio are
    going to be better than the last!

    <h2 style="text-align: center;"> Comming soon.. </h2>

    I have to fill this xd.

## Hosting the app

Well after all this is a personal website, but if there's someone that can make use of any part of the app, or just want to experiment, feel free to host it locally. 

Once you've cloned the project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
